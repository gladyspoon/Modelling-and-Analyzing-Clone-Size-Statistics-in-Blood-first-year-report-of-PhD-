# Modelling-and-Analyzing-Clone-Size-Statistics-in-Blood-first-year-report-of-PhD-

This repository contains R codes used for simulating the evolutionary dynamics and python notebooks used for 
visualization of simulated results and data analysis

All codes for simulation is contained within the folder 'R-code-simulations'

'Arbitrary feeding' and 'Inverse Problem - Chapter 1' are used for producing graphs in Chapter 2
(Models of evolutionary dynamics and somatic clone size statistics) of the first year report.

'Data analysis - Chapter 2' are pythons used for analysis in Chapter 3 (Multiple-driver mutations and genetic hitchhikers in the blood) of the first year report.
